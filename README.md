# Automobile Hands Free Voice Recognition

This is a simple voice recognition system that takes in the user's command and responds. Later builds of this project used different technologies, but this sample uses Google's voice recognition system.

The following commands are recognized:
- start simulation
- how fast am I going
- go faster
- slow down
- speed 55 (accepts any number within range and checks to avoid collision with next vehicle)
- stop
- state distance
- increase distance
- decrease distance
- distance 30 (sets the distance to the next vehicle)
- go around that car
- error for unrecognized command
